# TOSR-Digital-Platform

## Overview
The **Test of Semantic Reasoning (TOSR) Digital Platform** is a modern, tablet-based adaptation of the standardized paper-and-pencil assessment tool for children and adolescents ages 7 through 17. This digital version aims to streamline administration, capture rich response-time data, and maintain the psychometric integrity of the original TOSR while improving accessibility and user experience.

## Purpose
- Provide a digital interface for administering the TOSR subtests (vocabulary breadth, semantic reasoning).
- Enable precise measurement of response latencies and other performance metrics.
- Facilitate secure, anonymized data export for research and clinical analysis.
- Ensure the platform is accessible and age-appropriate for children as young as 7.

## Project Status
This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the development of the digital platform. The project is currently in early development.
